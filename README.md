# mpesa_integrations
A simplified way to use the daraja API for any python project
the objective is to create a project where I use a .ini file(to store all your mpesa app's credentials like secret) and a .py file to take care of the remaining procecess so that all you need to integrate mpesa in your app is just filling the .ini file and calling the function initiate_payment with the customers number and the anount as it's parameters
